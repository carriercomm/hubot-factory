# Hubot Factory

Hubot Factory is a web based production line for building your own
version of Hubot with the scripts you require ready to deploy straight to
Heroku or your own server.

## TODO

* Change `system()` calls to Heroku gem calls
* Allow users to pick and mix Hubot scripts which writes `hubot-scripts.json`
* Design the site
